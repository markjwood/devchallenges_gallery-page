<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71726788/147707216-9d8a43a6-b8c9-4a35-93e3-922eb80d290a.png)

This project was intended to practice responsive design. The resonsiveness turned out to be the easiest aspect of the project. I added some JavaScript to allow images to be clicked to enlarge, and to scroll through the enlarged images.

The image data is stored in a JS object inside the script. This could be moved into a separate file and imported.

### Built With

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/gcbWLxG6wdennelX7b8I) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

The interactive aspect was not a requirement of the challenge but was a fun addition. The user can click on an image to display an enlarged version in a modal, and within that modal, can page through the images.
